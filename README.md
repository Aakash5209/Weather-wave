# Description -
I recently developed a dynamic and user-friendly web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating a Weather API to provide real-time temperature information for user-specified locations.
Users can simply search for a location, and the application fetches and displays the current temperature.
In case of an incorrect location input, an alert feature ensures a prompt notification to the user.
This project not only showcases my proficiency in front-end technologies but also demonstrates the integration of API functionality to 
deliver accurate and responsive weather data to users in a user-friendly manner.
